Our support team can help with warranty claims.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">33. Do you offer virtual consultations?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Yes, we offer virtual consultations via video call for customers who can't visit our showroom or prefer remote assistance. To schedule one, fill out our consultation request form and select "Virtual Consultation" as your preferred method. You'll receive a link to join the video call at your scheduled time. Before your consultation, we recommend measuring your space and taking photos or video to share during the call. Virtual consultations typically last 30-60 minutes and cover the same topics as in-person meetings.</p>
